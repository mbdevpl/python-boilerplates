This package includes boilerplates for various common tasks in Python packages, such as building
the package, testing the packaging process, storing the package config, logging for the package
or creating a CLI.

Available boilerplates
======================

Setup boilerplate
-----------------

Module ``boilerplates.setup`` provides a class ``Package`` that abstracts out
many of the common tasks needed to set up the package. The class has a
``setup()`` class method that can be called from the ``if __name__ == '__main__'`` block
in your ``setup.py`` file.

To avoid setup script boilerplate, create ``setup.py`` file with the minimal contents as given
below and modify it according to the specifics of your package.

See the implementation of ``boilerplates.setup.Package`` for all other available options.
Some fields don't need to be entered and will be automatically initialised using various detectors.
Also, some fields have default values.
See ``DEFAULT_*`` constants in the ``boilerplates.setup`` for those values.

Example ``setup.py``:

.. code:: python

    """Setup script."""

    import boilerplates.setup


    class Package(boilerplates.setup.Package):
        """Package metadata."""

        name = ''
        description = ''
        url = 'https://github.com/mbdevpl/...'
        author = '...'
        author_email = '...'
        classifiers = [
            'Development Status :: 1 - Planning',
            'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.8',
            'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.9',
            'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.10',
            'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.11',
            'Programming Language :: Python :: 3 :: Only']
        keywords = []


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        Package.setup()

You will also need the following in your ``pyproject.toml`` file:

.. code:: toml

    [build-system]
    requires = ['boilerplates[setup] ~= <version>']

Packaging tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As an extension of setup boilerplate, there's an extra boilerplate for testing the packaging process,
in a way that enables 100% code coverage, including the ``setup.py`` script.

In order to use it, all you need to do is create a file as follows in your tests directory.

Example ``test/test_packaging.py``:

.. code:: python

    """Tests for packaging."""

    import boilerplates.packaging_tests


    class Tests(boilerplates.packaging_tests.PackagingTests):
        pass

And, you will need to add the following to your ``requirements_test.txt`` file (or equivalent):

.. code:: text

    boilerplates[packaging_tests] ~= <version>

Config boilerplate
------------------

Module ``boilerplates.config`` provides few utility functions useful to handle local configuration.

Example usage:

.. code:: python

    import boilerplates.config

    ...

    boilerplates.config.initialize_config_directory('app_name')

And, you will need to add the following to your ``requirements.txt`` file (or equivalent):

.. code:: text

    boilerplates[config] ~= <version>

Logging boilerplate
-------------------

Assumptions for this boilerplate are that you want to use the standard built-in Python
logging module (``logging``), and that your application probably has a CLI entry point
or some executable script, as opposed to only being a library.

To reduce boilerplate necessary to setup logging for such application,
add the following in your ``__main__.py``:

.. code:: python

    """Entry point of the command-line interface."""

    import boilerplates.logging


    class Logging(boilerplates.logging.Logging):
        """Logging configuration."""

        packages = ['package_name']


    ...


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        Logging.configure()
        ...

More advanced usage could be (just changing the ``Logging`` class definition):

.. code:: python

    class Logging(boilerplates.logging.Logging):
        """Logging configuration."""

        packages = ['package_name']
        level_package = logging.INFO
        enable_file = True
        directory = 'package_name'

You can and should adjust the class fields to your needs, please take a look
at the ``boilerplates.logging.Logging`` class implementation for details.

You may also use this boilerplate in tests even if your code is just a library. In such case,
add the following to your ``test/__init__.py``:

.. code:: python

    """Initialization of tests."""

    import logging

    import boilerplates.logging


    class TestsLogging(boilerplates.logging.Logging):
        """Logging configuration for tests."""

        packages = ['package_name']
        level_package = logging.INFO


    TestsLogging.configure()

If you wish, you can make your test logging config be a variant of your application logging config,
like so:

.. code:: python

    """Initialization of tests."""

    from my_package.__main__ import Logging


    class TestsLogging(Logging):
        """Logging configuration for tests."""

        enable_file = False

As for using the logging in your code, you can use it as usual, for example:

.. code:: python

    # in a standalone script:
    _LOG = logging.getLogger(pathlib.Path(__file__).stem)
    # in a standalone script that can also be imported:
    _LOG = logging.getLogger(pathlib.Path(__file__).stem if __name__ == '__main__' else __name__)
    # in __main__.py:
    _LOG = logging.getLogger(pathlib.Path(__file__).parent.name)
    # in usual module files:
    _LOG = logging.getLogger(__name__)

And, you will need to add the following to your ``requirements.txt`` file (or equivalent):

.. code:: text

    boilerplates[logging] ~= <version>

CLI boilerplate
---------------

This boilerplate aims at making CLIs easier to write, by providing a few utility functions.

Your example ``cli.py`` file which defines your command-line interface may look like:

.. code:: python

    """Command-line interface definition."""

    import argparse

    import boilerplates.cli

    def main(args=None):
        """Entry point of the command-line interface."""
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
            prog='my-cli',
            description='''My command-line interface.''',
            epilog=boilerplates.cli.make_copyright_notice(
                2019, 2023, author='The Author', license_name='Apache License 2.0',
                url='https://github.com/...'))

        boilerplates.cli.add_version_option(parser, '1.0.1')
        boilerplates.cli.add_verbosity_group(parser)

        parsed_args = parser.parse_args(args)

        verbosity = boilerplates.cli.get_verbosity_level(parsed_args)
        ...

You can see the above example in action in the `<examples.ipynb>`_ notebook.
Please see the ``boilerplates.cli`` module for details of the available features.

And then, an example ``__main__.py`` file may look like:

.. code:: python

    """Entry point of the command-line interface."""

    # PYTHON_ARGCOMPLETE_OK

    from my_package import cli


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        cli.main()

And, you will need to add the following to your ``requirements.txt`` file (or equivalent):

.. code:: text

    boilerplates[cli] ~= <version>

Then, the output of running ``python -m my_pacakge -h`` will look like:

.. code:: text

    usage: my-cli [-h] [--version] [--verbose | --quiet | --verbosity LEVEL]

    My command-line interface.

    options:
    -h, --help         show this help message and exit
    --version          show program's version number and exit
    --verbose, -v      be more verbose than by default (repeat up to 3 times for
                        stronger effect)
    --quiet, -q        be more quiet than by default (repeat up to 2 times for
                        stronger effect)
    --verbosity LEVEL  set verbosity level explicitly (normally from 0 to 5)

And the output of running ``python -m my_pacakge --version`` will look like:

.. code:: text

    my-cli 1.0.1, Python 3.11.0 (main, Feb 13 2023, 00:02:15) [GCC 12.1.0]

Git repo tests boilerplate
--------------------------

This boilerplate aims at making it easier to test your package in a context of a git repository.

It's only useful if you create a Python package that operates on git repositories, and helps to
create and modify synthetic git repositories for testing purposes.

To start using ``boilerplates.git_repo_tests``, you can start with a file like this
in your test folder, for example ``test/test_with_git_repo.py``:

.. code:: python

    """Perform tests on and in synthetic git repositories."""

    import pathlib

    import boilerplates.git_repo_tests


    class Tests(boilerplates.git_repo_tests.GitRepoTests):

        ...

However, you will need to check the ``boilerplates.git_repo_tests.GitRepoTests`` class
for details of available features.

And, you will need to add the following to your ``requirements_test.txt`` file (or equivalent):

.. code:: text

    boilerplates[git_repo_tests] ~= <version>
